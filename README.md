# Automated_Circuit_To_MAGIC_VLSI
Project Name: Automated Circuit To MAGIC VLSI layout Using Open Source EDA Tools.

VLSI design flow includes system specifcation, architectural ddesign, functional & logic design, circuit design, physical design, fabrication, pacakging & testing, chip. In physical esign process like  layouting, routing, placement, etc are involved.
This project aims to convert a circuit into its MAGIC Layout format. MAGIC software is a open source EDA tool which is used for making layout of circuit. 

Basically if we are representing a circuit into code format then using some coding algorithm we can implement its magic VLSI layout.
So, here circuit netlist,design rules, librecell layout are used to generate output.

Basic algorithm is :  


Input files [Spice Netlist + Design Rules]   ----->   Librecell Layout as conversion tool    ----->    Output i.e layout [GDS,LEF,MAG]

We can generate spice netlist of any circuit using circuit design tools,open source EDA tools. Design rules are the rules which are associated with Æ› rule used in stick diagram, layout. Stick diagram represents layer information through color code. Layout consists of contacts, metal, polysilicon, etc. This layers are represented using color code in stick diagram.

## Let's Start

Steps Involved : 

- Installing Python3, Ngspice, Z3 Solver
- Creating a python virtual environment
- Installing librecell using git
- Applying Conversion Commands
- Installing MAGIC To see Layout

### Downloading Python3, Ngspice, Z3 Solver 

For ubuntu, using terminal we will download required tools.
Command to install ngspice & install  is : 
```
sudo pacman -S install ngspice z3
```

To install python3 use following command : 
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

We will also require MAGIC software to check/read Layout(.mag file)
To download MAGIC :

```
sudo apt-get install magic
```

To check whether all tools are installed : Try for checkpoint

Checkpoint1 : Type `ngspice` for ngspice; Give command `z3 --help` for z3 solver ; Give command `python3` for python.

Now next we need to work on python virtual environment :
Using following commands we can work on python virtual envrionment

```
python3 -m venv my-librecell-env

source ./my-librecell-env/bin/activate
```
### Installing librecell

Now we need to install librecell from git .
Commands to download & install :
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/tok/librecell.git
cd librecell
```

```
cd librecell-common
python3 setup.py develop
cd ..
```

```
cd librecell-layout
python3 setup.py develop
cd ..
```

```
cd librecell-lib
python3 setup.py develop
cd ..
```

Checkpoint 2: 
To make sure that llibrecell is installed or not use command :
`librecell --h`

If terminal is showing information or help commands then librecell is installed.

Next we need to deal with actual files that is spice netlist files, tech files, directories,etc.
 We need to make directory in lbrecell layout folder.
 Make sure that you are in librecell folder right now [From librecell folder we will go to librecell-layout]
 
 `cd librecell-layout`
 
 Make directory :
 'mkdir /tmp/mylibrary'
 
 ### Conversion command
 
 ```
 lclayout --output-dir [Here your output will be stored] --tech [design_tech_file.py] --netlist [Spice_netlist.sp] --cell [Cell_Name]
 ````
 
 For example : Use dummy_tech.py file as design tech file.Use AND2X1.sp OR LATCH.sp as spice netlist file. Use corresponding cell name ex: --cell AND2X1   OR   --cell LATCH.
 
 File name must be with location of file. Ex : If my all files are stored in Desktop then I will use 
 ```
 lclayout --output-dir /home/user/Desktop --tech /home/user/Desktop/librecell_tech.py --netlist /home/user/Desktop/cells.sp --cell LATCH
 ```
 OR 
 
 ```
 lclayout --output-dir /tmp/mylibrary --tech examples/dummy_tech.py --netlist examples/cells.sp --cell AND2X1
 
 ```
 
 ### MAGIC Layout 
 
 Checkpoint 3 : To make sure MAGIC is installed make a file of magic using `magic checkpoint3.mag`
 If MAGIC with blank project is opened then MAGIC is installed.
 
 i. AND2X1 : I have used AND2X1 Sspice netlist & cell to generate layout of AND2X1.
 
 Use command to generate layout 
 
 ```
 magic AND2X1.mag
 
 ```
 
 Output AND2X1 :
 
 <img src ="https://github.com/itsvivekghosh/automated-circuit-to-MAGIC-vlsi-using-eda-tool/blob/master/Images/Commands_Output_SS_AND2X1.png">
 
 ii. LATCH : I have used LATCH spice netlist & cell name to generate layout of LATCH.
 
 ```
 magic LATCH.mag
 
 ```
 
 Output LATCH:

 [Hit CTRL if cursor is blinking again & again & Make sure that ouput gd files is stored on Desktop]
 
 ### Input & Output Files
 
 So using librecell we get to know that we can convert spice netlist to its layout.
 
 Input files used :   
 - Spice netlist [.sp]
 - Tech file [.py]
 - cell name
                      
 Output Files obtained :  
 - Graphic Database System File .gds]
 - Library Exchange Format [.lef]
